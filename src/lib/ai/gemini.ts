      1. You MUST ONLY generate predictions for the user's zip code location.
      2. DO NOT include predictions for any other locations that might be in the data.
      3. If the historical or forecast data doesn't contain the user's exact location, use your knowledge to determine what location corresponds to the zip code and generate predictions for that location only.
      4. The predictions should be specific to the types of disasters that are relevant to the user's location based on geography, climate, and historical patterns.
      5. In the summary, explain what location the zip code corresponds to and why the predictions are relevant to that specific area.
      6. If you're not certain about the exact location of the zip code, make your best determination and explain your reasoning.
      7. The response MUST ONLY contain predictions for the user's location, not for any other locations in the data.
